This is a beginner's Haskell guide by me, Andre Popovitch! My goal is for this to be a useful resource to give a Haskell newcomer. I welcome any typo fixes, wording changes, etc. so if you have any of these to contribute, please leave an issue/pull request. You can also find me on the [Functional Programming Discord](https://discord.gg/6XQC7KA) under the name @likliklik, or at my email (`andre@popovit.ch`). I'm always happy to help answer Haskell questions.

While this is a beginner's guide, I want to cover advanced and useful topics! Here are the topics that are currently on the agenda:

1) A chapter on the Pipes library

2) A chapter on concurrency and parallelism 

3) A chapter on writing optimized Haskell 

4) A chapter on Template Haskell

If you're knowledgable in any of these topics and are willing to answer a few questions, please shoot me an email. Any other ideas are welcome!

The styling is in traditional Markdown, but for our custom typesetting we have access to the following additions!

```
!newthought(Makes text small caps - I may decide to remove this entirely)

!sidenote(This is a sidenote - it has a number)

!marginnote(This is a margin note - like a sidenote, but without a number)

!figure(This is the caption for a figure - the link to the figure goes next. The figure will be the width of the text, without the margin)(./image/path/image.jpg)

!marginfigure(This is a margin figure caption. The figure goes in the margin with the margin notes.)(./image/path/image.jpg)

!fullwidthfigure(This is a full-width figure caption. The figure can be the full width of the text + margin)(./image/path/image.jpg)
```
